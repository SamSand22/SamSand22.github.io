# My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4 Part 1
Lab 4 was one of the earliest labs we did with still some limited knowledge of C++. I liked this lab because it had us utilize math and the tools we knew at the time to convert measurements in the metric system to the US system of measurements (teaspoons, tablespoons, etc.). This lab was both useful in the sense that it had a practical use as well as helping increase my understanding of the language and what you could accomplish with only a small set of tools. 

Lab 5 Part 2
Lab 5 was one of the more difficult labs to complete, as me and my partner had to meet up after lab hours to finish it. Part 2 required us to convert decimal feet to feet and inches, using different if statements to determine the exact amount. Although more demanding than the labs before it, I enjoyed the challenge and was eager to learn more after completing it. 

Lab 7
Lab 7 required us to determine parking rules for a neighborhood, with parameters for different streets, times, and days of the week. Utilizing bools and if statements, we had to work around unique parameters for each street as they each had different times and dates dictating when cars can or cannot park there. These parameters provided a engaging challenge that helped improve my problem solving abilities as well as my proficiency with the C++ tools at my disposal.
